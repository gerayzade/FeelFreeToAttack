Before you start working with it:
<ul>
<li>Upload all files from directory to your server (you can also use EasyPHP DevServer or XAMPP).</li>
<li>Create new database and import `users` table there (<i>users.sql</i>).</li>
<li>Change database credentials in <i>config.php</i> and <i>db.php</i> files.</li>
</ul>

<b>   *</b> Uncomment 18th line in <i>user.php</i> in order to make application more secured.
