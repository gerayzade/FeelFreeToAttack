Before you start working with it:
<ul>
<li>Upload all files from directory to your server (you can also use EasyPHP DevServer or XAMPP).</li>
<li>Create new database and import `users` table there (<b>users.sql</b>).</li>
<li>Change database credentials in <b>config.php</b> and <b>db.php</b> files.</li>
</ul>

<b>   *</b> Uncomment 18th line in <b>user.php</b> in order to do application more secured.
